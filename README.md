# Text-Editor

## Acceptance Criteria 
 * a client server folder structure
* WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory my application should start up the backend and serve the client
* WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
* WHEN I run my webpack plugin i have generated a HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
* WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application  I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
* WHEN I open the text editor I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
* WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
* WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
* WHEN I click on the Install button I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
* WHEN I load my web application I have a registered service worker using workbox
* WHEN I register a service worker my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
* WHEN I deploy to Heroku I have proper build scripts for a webpack application


## Current State
* a client server folder structure
* WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory my application should start up the backend and serve the client

## Left to do 
* WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application  I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
* WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
* WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
